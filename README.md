# Math-Table-Generator

### Description:  
Using the Vim text editor, I wrote a shell script program that generates math tables.  
The program asks the user to enter the symbol corresponding to the available operations (Addition => +, Subtraction  => -, Multiplication  => *, Division => /, Exponent => ^).  
The program then asks the user to enter the operand (which can range from 1-15).  
Based on the user's input data, the appropriate math table when then be generated and displayed.  

### Technology Used:  
- Bash
